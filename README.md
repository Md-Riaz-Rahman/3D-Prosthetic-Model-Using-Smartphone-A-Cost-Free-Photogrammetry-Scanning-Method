# 3D Prosthetic Model Using Smartphone: A Cost-Free Photogrammetry Scanning Method

A cost-free method for creating 3D prosthetic socket using photogrammetry with a smartphone and free software.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to generate a 3D model of a prosthetic mould using photogrammetry techniques. The steps include capturing photos of the prosthetic mould, creating a 3D model using 3D Zephyr, editing and scaling the model in Meshmixer, and making digital modifications to create a printable prosthetic socket.

## Equipment Used
- **Smartphone**: OnePlus 7T
- **Computer**: Laptop with Intel Core i5 8th Gen and 8GB RAM
- **Software**: 3D Zephyr, Meshmixer

## Steps

### Step 1: Taking Photos

#### Preparation
- **Choose a Suitable Environment**: Select a well-lit environment with consistent lighting conditions to ensure clear and uniform images. Natural light or diffuse artificial light is preferable to avoid harsh shadows.
- **Prepare the Mould**: Make alignment lines in both sagittal and coronal planes as references for further processing. Mark and measure the mould length for digital scaling later. Select an appropriate position where the mould texture is visible and you can move around the mould.
- **Clean the Camera Lens**: Wipe the camera lens to remove any smudges or dirt that could affect image quality.

#### Image Capture
- **Positioning**: Place the mould in the center of your smartphone's viewfinder.
- **Camera Settings**: Set your camera to manual mode, if possible, to control exposure settings such as ISO, shutter speed, and focus. This helps maintain consistency across images.
- **Capture Photos**: Take a series of overlapping photos (about 60-70%) by moving around the mould. Vary the angles and heights for comprehensive coverage.

#### Image Processing
- **Transfer Images**: Transfer the captured images to a computer for processing using a USB cable, cloud storage, or another preferred method.

### Step 2: Produce 3D Model

#### Photogrammetry Software
- **Software Options**: Use free software like Meshroom or 3D Zephyr. In this project, we will use 3D Zephyr.
- **Load Images**: Load the captured images into 3D Zephyr by clicking on Workflow > New Project > Next > Select folder > Next.
- **Camera Calibration**: The software will perform automatic camera calibration. Click Next > Next to proceed.
- **Reconstruction**: Start the reconstruction process by clicking Run. The software will align all photos by matching overlapping areas and colors. Click Finish to view the sparse point cloud.
- **3D Model Generation**: Click on Workflow > 3D model generation > Next > Next > Next > Run and wait for the process to complete. Clean up unnecessary parts using Editing > Hand > Poly > Select unwanted area > Delete.
- **Textured Mesh Generation**: Click on Workflow > Textured mesh generation > Next > Next > Next > Run. Wait for the process to complete.
- **Export**: Export the model in a compatible format (e.g., OBJ, FBX) by clicking on Export > Export Textured mesh > Export > Select Folder > Save.

#### Tips and Considerations
- **Consistent Lighting**: Maintain consistent lighting conditions throughout the image capture process.
- **Stability**: Walk with bent knees for better stability and use a stable grip or tripod to avoid camera shake.
- **Patience**: Processing time may vary based on the complexity of the model and your computerâ€™s capabilities.

### Step 3: Processing the 3D Model

#### Mesh Processing Software
- **Options**: Blender, MeshLab, Meshmixer. In this project, we will use Meshmixer.

#### Meshmixer Steps
- **Run the Software**: Open Meshmixer.
- **Import 3D Model**: Click on Import > Select file > Open.
- **Alignment and Cleanup**: Align the model using the reference lines on the mould. Make a duplicate copy of the original model.
- **Cut and Scale**: Cut the model using the Plane Cut tool based on the measurements. Scale the model using the length measurements taken before.
- **Smoothing and Design**: Smooth the 3D model and design according to the prescription. Compare with the original 3D model for volume changes.
- **Fitting Check**: Cross-check all circumference measurements to match the goal measurements for patient fitting.
- **Export to STL**: Once satisfied with the model, export it as an STL file for printing.
